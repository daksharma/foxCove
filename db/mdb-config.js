Hi! I'm your friendly, go with the flow Mongo database. You can use me for all sorts
of stuff, Bill data, State Capitols, parking hours. All you have to do is make
a schema to get started, and my model based record management is a snap to use.

For now let's keep the schemas here, but like children, in time, they will move out.
